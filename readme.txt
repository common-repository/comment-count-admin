comment authors by comment url. The comment count appears next to the comment authors name in the "Edit Comments"
listing of comments and in the "Discussion" box of the "Edit Post" page for a post with comments. Anonymous comment
authors are identified by the url they provided when commenting, all WordPress users are identified by their user id.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip the ZIP plugin file
2. Copy the `comment-count-admin` folder into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
